# abberition

### Aberration
1. A departure from what is normal, usual, or expected, typically one that is unwelcome
2. The failure of rays to converge at one focus because of limitations or defects in an optical system


### Apparition

1. An unusual or unexpected sight or phenomenon strange apparitions in the sky
2. The act of becoming visible

The goal of abberition is to get the most out of deeply flawed astronomical images.
